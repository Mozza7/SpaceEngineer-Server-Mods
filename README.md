# SpaceEngineers dedicated server add mods - STEAM ONLY

**USAGE**  

**NOGUI:**  
1. Place the downloaded EXE file in a folder with your Sandbox_config.sbc (see below) file and a text file named mods.txt with links to workshop items as per below example   
2. Run SE_mods-nogui.exe

**GUI:**  
1. Run SE_mods-gui.exe  
2. Select your Sandbox_config.sbc file, if not complete already, edit your mods.txt file, hit submit

**Having trouble?**  

**File Not Found Error:**  
-This error indicates Sandbox_config.sbc could not be found. Please check the path you have selected, and ensure you have selected the Sandbox_config.sbc file  

**Permission Error:**  
-This error indicates you do not have permissions to read/write Sandbox_config.sbc. You may need to copy the file to a place your system has permissions and select this as the location, then manually overwrite the original  

**It's not writing my mods to Sandbox_config.sbc:**  
-Ensure mods.txt has been edited and is in the SAME location as the exe (use the Edit mods.txt button to ensure you are editing the correct file)  
-Check that you are using STEAM mods, at this time only STEAM is supported  
-Check the below example mods.txt to ensure you are formatting correctly  

See below for an example mods.txt file, and how to ensure your Sandbox_config.sbc is setup ready.  
The script will save any mods you have already added, and only add new ones.  


WHY?  

I host my server on unraid, it's a slight inconvenience to either manually add them into the file or spin up an instance on my local machine to copy over. I decided to make this script to ease my inconvenience.
